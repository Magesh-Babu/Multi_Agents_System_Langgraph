      "1. **Debt Growth**: Tesla's total debt has increased significantly from 2022 to 2024, indicating that the company has been leveraging more debt in recent years.\n",

This could indicate strategic borrowing for expansion or operational needs. However, the reduction in debt from 2021 to 2022 suggests prior efforts to streamline liabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Implications**: While rising debt can support growth initiatives, it also increases financial risk. Investors should monitor Tesla's ability to service this debt, possibly through metrics like debt-to-equity ratio or interest coverage.\n",

      "Overall, Tesla's balance sheet highlights a shift toward higher leverage, which may signal confidence in future revenue generation but warrants close attention to its financial health and operational performance.
